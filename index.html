   		 <p id="arg">Rama is, in the words of the sage Valmiki, sab ke priya sab ke hitkari (beloved of all and loved by all). He is benevolence incarnate, chivalrous and valorous but always gentle and caring, compassionate towards the weak and the vulnerable, and magnanimous towards the enemy even when he chastises them for what is wrong. </p>
   		 <p id="arg">Countless examples can be given to illustrate this central message of Tulsi, but given the constraints of space I will mention only a few. In Tulsi’s famous stanza describing the birth of Rama, he writes in the very first line: ‘Bhaye pragata kripala, deen dayala….’.</p>
